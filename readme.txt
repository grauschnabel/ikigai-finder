* Customizable system instructions and AI parameters
* Responsive design that looks good on all devices

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an OpenAI API key? =

Yes, this plugin requires a valid OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from OpenAI (openai.com).

= Is the plugin GDPR compliant? =

The plugin itself does not permanently store user responses. However, data is sent to the OpenAI API. Please review OpenAI's privacy policies and ensure you inform users accordingly.

= Which GPT model should I use? =

For best results, we recommend GPT-4. GPT-3.5-Turbo also works, but GPT-4 provides deeper guidance.
